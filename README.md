### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I will be using this page to list my past professional works (no public repo) and repository that I feel worth sharing.

I have been working professionally as Software Developer for at least 5 years. Only recently started using GitHub to put my personal projects.

My past works (just listing that I feel worth checking out):

- [Marutama Ramen](https://marutama.com.sg) <br />
Stacks: Laravel PHP Framework, SASS, JavaScript <br />
This website has CMS to display News, Menu, Shop and Reservation availability.

- [At Twenty](https://attwenty.sg) <br />
Stacks: PHP, SASS, JavaScript, GSAP (GreenSock) <br />
Showcasing animation with GreenSock javascript plugin.

- [TOHO Singapore](https://to-ho.com.sg) <br />
Stacks: PHP, SASS, JavaScript, VueJS <br />
Company website with CMS for News and Products. VueJS is used under [PRODUCTS](https://to-ho.com.sg/ja/products) page. <br />


Personal:

- [Cafe Employee](https://github.com/welsontn/cafe-employee) <br />
Stacks: React with Redux and Router, Node, Docker <br />
Current project used to learn step-by-step as I slowly add more commonly used stacks like Redux and Router.
