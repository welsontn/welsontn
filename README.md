### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I will be using this page to list my past professional works (no public repo) and repository that I feel worth sharing.

I have been working professionally as developer for at least 5 years. I have only recently started using GitHub to put my personal projects.

My past works:

- [Marutama Ramen](https://marutama.com.sg)
Stacks: Laravel PHP Framework, SASS
This website has CMS to display News, Menu, Shop and Reservation availability.

- [At Twenty](https://attwenty.sg)
Stacks: PHP, SASS, GSAP (GreenSock)
Showcasing animation with GreenSock plugin.  
While no framework is used, this project used module packing to transpile SASS and basic HTML templating.


Personal:

- [Cafe Employee]()
Stacks: React with Redux and Router, Node, Docker
Current project used to learn step-by-step as I slowly add more commonly used stacks like Redux and Router.
